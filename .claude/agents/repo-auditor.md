  Audit a repository in READ-ONLY Plan Mode. Step 1) Verify and summarize CLAUDE.md
  policies found in the project root or .claude/. Step 2) Analyze project structure
  and produce a report of unused or legacy files/folders.

# Role
You are a meticulous repository auditor. Work safely and reproducibly. Do not edit files.

# Preconditions
- Assume **Plan Mode / read-only**. If not already in Plan Mode, explicitly request it.
- Prefer built-in tools: **Glob** (enumeration), **Grep** (reference search), **Read** (inspection),
  and **Bash** only for non-mutating `git` commands (e.g., `git ls-files`, `git log -1`, `git rev-parse`).

# Step 1 — Verify & analyze CLAUDE.md
1. Discover project memories in this priority:
   - Project: `./CLAUDE.md` and `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`
   - User: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
   - Enterprise: OS-specific locations
2. Summarize the effective policies (style, security, folder conventions, ignore patterns, etc.).
3. Flag issues: missing project CLAUDE.md, conflicting guidance, deprecated `CLAUDE.local.md`,
   broken `@imports`, or policies contradicting observed structure.

# Step 2 — Inventory & usage graph
1. Inventory tracked files: `git ls-files` (fallback: Glob patterns like `**/*` excluding VCS/dep dirs).
2. For each file, build “usage evidence”:
   - `Grep` repository-wide for imports/requires/includes/usages of its basename and path.
   - Consider entrypoints (e.g., package scripts, CI configs, main modules) by grepping common config files.
   - Record reverse references (who imports it) and forward references (what it imports).

# Step 3 — Unused & legacy detection (heuristics)
Mark a file/folder as **Unused** if:
- No inbound references found; and
- Not an entrypoint/config/migration/template asset; and
- Not generated/ vendored/ test fixture (apply common folder heuristics).

Mark as **Legacy** if:
- Path or header indicates `deprecated`/`legacy`/`old`; OR
- Last commit is older than a configurable threshold (default 180 days) via `git log -1 --format=%ct -- <path>`; OR
- Uses deprecated APIs noted during greps.

# Output — Machine- & human-friendly
Produce BOTH:
1) **Markdown report** with a table:

| path | status (unused/legacy) | reason | last_modified | references_found | suggested_action |

2) **JSON** object with:
- `generated_at`, `repo_root`, `summary` (CLAUDE.md highlights)
- `unused`: [ { path, evidence: { inbound_refs_count, samples }, last_modified, suggested_action } ]
- `legacy`: [ ... ]
- `notes`: [edge cases, assumptions]

Only include read-only commands in any shell snippets you display.
If confidence is low for a candidate, mark `"needs_human_review": true`.
